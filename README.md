This is the planning phase of the project. Phase 1 - 

Project Background - 

![Cyckistic](https://github.com/jivaniyash/Google-Foundations-of-Business-Intelligence-Coursera-Project/blob/main/_images/_Cyclistic.png)

Cyclistic has partnered with the city of New York to provide shared bikes. Currently, there are bike stations located throughout Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers are able to rent bikes for easy travel between stations at these locations.

Cyclistic’s Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year. The team wants to understand how their customers are using their bikes; their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations.

Cyclistic has captured data points for every trip taken by their customers, including:

- Trip start time and location (station number, and its latitude/longitude)

- Trip end time and location (station number, and its latitude/longitude)

- The rented bike’s identification number

- The type of customer (either a one-time customer, or a subscriber)

The dataset includes millions of rides, so the team wants a dashboard that summarizes key insights. Business plans that are driven by customer insights are more successful than plans driven by just internal staff observations. The executive summary must include key data points that are summarized and aggregated in order for the leadership team to get a clear vision of how customers are using Cyclistic.

[Stakeholder-Requirements-Document---Cyclistic.pdf](https://github.com/jivaniyash/Google-Foundations-of-Business-Intelligence-Coursera-Project/blob/main/Stakeholder-Requirements-Document---Cyclistic.pdf) contains brief information about the requirements which are needed for the stakeholders of the project.

The Stakeholder Requirements Document enables to capture stakeholder requests and requirements to understand their needs before planning the rest of the project details or strategy. It answers the following questions:

- Business problem: What is the primary question to be answered or problem to be solved?

- Stakeholders: Who are the major stakeholders of this project, and what are their job titles?

- Stakeholder usage details: How will the stakeholders use the BI tool?

Primary requirements: What requirements must be met by this BI tool in order for this project to be successful?

Here are some questions BI professionals ask in order to successfully complete this document:

- What questions must be answered before starting this project?

- What does the BI team need to know before starting this project?

- What are the questions that must be answered/problems that must be solved by this project?

- What datasets are considered important to this project?

- Who should have access to the dashboard? Will the entire dashboard be visible to all stakeholders?

[Project-Requirements-Document---Cyclistic.pdf](https://github.com/jivaniyash/Google-Foundations-of-Business-Intelligence-Coursera-Project/blob/main/Project-Requirements-Document---Cyclistic.pdf) contains project requirements data for the successful completion of the project.

The Project Requirements Document contains the following details:

Purpose: Briefly describe why this project is happening and explanation of why the company should invest its resources in it.

Key dependencies: Detail the major elements of this project. Include the team, primary contacts, and expected deliverables. Are there any inter-team deliverables required?

- Stakeholder requirements: List the established stakeholder requirements, based on the Stakeholder Requirements Document. Prioritize the requirements as: R - required, D - desired, or N - nice to have.

- Success criteria: Clarify what success looks like for this project. Include explicit statements about how to measure success. Use SMART criteria.

- User journeys: Document the current user experience and the ideal future experience.

- Assumptions: Explicitly and clearly state any assumptions you are making.

- Compliance and privacy: Include compliance, privacy, or legal dimensions to consider.

- Accessibility: List key considerations for creating accessible reports for all users. Who needs to access this feature? How are they viewing and interacting with it?

- Roll-out plan: Briefly describe the expected scope, priorities and timeline. Consider at what points during the rollout will measurements be made to determine whether the feature is performing as expected? Is there a rollback plan and timeline if this feature does not meet its intended goals?

[Strategy-Document---Cyclistic](https://github.com/jivaniyash/Google-Foundations-of-Business-Intelligence-Coursera-Project/blob/main/Strategy-Document---Cyclistic.pdf) contains Dashboard Functionality and the metrics and dimensions to be used in forming various charts in the dashboard.

The Strategy Document is a collaborative place to align with stakeholders about project deliverables. You will work together to establish information about dashboard functionality and associated metrics and charts.

This is a time to flesh out what metrics will be required, how metrics are calculated, and any limitations or assumptions that exist about the data. Stakeholders think through these details and help the BI professional make final project decisions. Then, the BI professional provides stakeholders with a dashboard mockup to get valuable feedback.

Generally, the BI professional will create the document and request review and sign-off from important stakeholders. Then they can begin working on the project with all of the details they need.
